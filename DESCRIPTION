Description: This package combines other tools and packages to more
    efficiently and quickly implement Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering
    (MESF) for larger data sets. MESF is a useful tool for addressing
    spatial autocorrelation. Credit to previous creators whose code was modified
    and built upon for this package (Matthew Cooper for moranfast package and 
    Roger Bivand and Pedro Peres-Neto for function ME from spatialreg package).
